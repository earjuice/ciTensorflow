Tensorflow C++ api for Cinder
This is a Tensorflow C++ Cinder Block for Windows 10. 
Should be compatible with OSX/Linux?

Link prebuilt Tensorflow binaries from https://github.com/hluu11/SimpleTF-CPP
If you figure out a succesful method to build your own Tensorflow binaries on Windows 10 with Cuda support, let me know.
Example is using Face Detection model..  
Trying to get this block up to par with Memo's ofxMSATensorflow. https://github.com/memo/ofxMSATensorFlow
Any help is appreciated. Cheers.
