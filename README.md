Tensorflow C++ api for Cinder
This is a Tensorflow C++ Cinder Block for Windows 10. 
Should be compatible with OSX/Linux?

Link prebuilt Tensorflow binaries from https://github.com/hluu11/SimpleTF-CPP
Link the binary and make sure your env variables point to the proper Cuda 9.2.
Also need Cinder's opencv block.  
This example uses Spout to stream the media in instead of loading files.
Example is using Face Detection model..  
If you figure out a succesful method to build your own Tensorflow binaries on Windows 10 with Cuda support, let me know.
Trying to get this block up to par with Memo's ofxMSATensorflow. https://github.com/memo/ofxMSATensorFlow
Any help is appreciated. Cheers.
