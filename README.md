# ciTensorflow
Tensorflow C++ api for Cinder
This is a Tensorflow C++ Cinder Block for Windows 10. 
Should be compatible with OSX/Linux?
Requires :
Tensorflow Binary
OpenCV Cinder Block
This example also uses Spout Cinder block;

Link prebuilt Tensorflow binaries from https://github.com/hluu11/SimpleTF-CPP
Link the binary and make sure your env variables point to the proper Cuda 9.2.
Example is using Face Detection model..  
If you figure out a succesful method to build your own Tensorflow binaries on Windows 10 with Cuda support, let me know.
Trying to get this block up to par with Memo's ofxMSATensorflow. https://github.com/memo/ofxMSATensorFlow
Any help is appreciated. Cheers.
